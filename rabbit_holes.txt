This file will contain a list of questions that arise as I am researching.
I will be revisiting these questions over time to gain answers.
====================================
Unanswered:

- How do you change the percentages of states?
- Why are phases present in quantum computing if they just cancel out to 1?
- Why are only reversable gates used in circuits?
- How is the general state of a qubit written in terms of sine and cosine? And is this form purely for use on the
  Bloch sphere?
- What does it mean for a quantum gate to be a "unitary operator"
====================================
Answered (-ish):

- How do qubits have exponentially more states than classical bits?
	* So far, I believe this to be because a qubit's basis states (as represented by classical binary) are
	  equivalent to normal bits, but those are a small subset of all of the possible states for a qubit
	  (that is, the entangled states make ups the rest of the total states)
