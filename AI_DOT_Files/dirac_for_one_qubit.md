## Dirac Notation for One Qubit

[//]: # (Paul Dirac was an English theoretical physicist.)

- Also known as "bra-ket" notation
  
[//]: # (The symbols below are Greek psi "sigh" and phi)

'ket' $\to | \psi \rangle$    
'bra' $\to \langle \psi |$    
'bra-ket' $\to \langle \psi | \phi \rangle$

[//]: # (Only using 'ket' for the rest of the lecture.)

- Dirac notation still uses probability amplitudes.     
- General Form:

$$
| \psi \rangle = \alpha_0 | 0 \rangle + \alpha_1 | 1 \rangle
$$

where $\alpha_0$ and $\alpha_1$ are the probability amplitudes associated with states 0 and 1 respectively.

State 0:   
$\hspace{8em}$ $| \psi \rangle = 1 \cdot| 0 \rangle + 0 \cdot | 1 \rangle$      
$\hspace{8em}$ $| \psi \rangle = | 0 \rangle$

State 1:   
$\hspace{8em}$ $| \psi \rangle = 0 \cdot | 0 \rangle + 1 \cdot | 1 \rangle$      
$\hspace{8em}$ $| \psi \rangle = | 1 \rangle$

[//]: # (Dirac notation follows the rules of algebra for the most part)

Exercise: write the coin flip state in Dirac notation.

[//]: # (Work out the answer on the whiteboard.)
[//]: # (We still follow Born's rule and the normalization constraint.)
[//]: # (Only difference is the notation.)
