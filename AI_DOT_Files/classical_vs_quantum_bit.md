## Classical Bit vs. Quantum Bit

- A classical bit is deterministic
- {Insert a classic NOT gate here}

Exercise 1: fill out the truth table below.

| Input | Output |
| ----- | ------ |
|   0   |        |
|   1   |        |     

- A qubit is probabilistic
- {Insert a "coin flip" gate here}

Exercise 2: fill out the truth table below.

| Input | Output |
| ----- | ------ |
|   0   |        |
|   1   |        |

[//]: # (We don't know the value of the output until we measure it, similar to flipping a coin.)
[//]: # (Recall that the output values must meet the Normalization Constraint.)
