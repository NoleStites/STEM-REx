## Born's Rule

Probability Amplitude    
: A complex number returned by the Schrodinger equation that is used to to find the
probability of an event occuring

[//]: # (Schrodinger's equation is the Newton's Laws of the quantum world.)     
[//]: # (Will only look at non-complex probability amplitudes.)

Born's Rule    
: $\text{The probability of any given event} = |\text{probability amplitude of event}|^2$

Example: Given an event has a probability amplitude of $\frac{1}{2}$, what is the 
         probability of the event occuring?
