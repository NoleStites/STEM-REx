## Intro To Quantum

- Quantum mechanics was created in the 1920s by Erwin Schrodinger, Paul Dirac, and others.
- "Quantum" describes objects at an atomic/subatomic scale.

[//]: # (Provide an example to better picture the size of atoms.)

- The behavior of atoms cannot be explained by classical mechanics.

[//]: # (Classical mechanics, applied to "large" objects, doesn't work on very small objects.)

- Quantum computing harnesses the power of quantum mechanics.
