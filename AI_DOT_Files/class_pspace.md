## Class PSPACE

- The complexity of an algorithm is commonly based on the input size and is most often defined by
its efficiency, but not always.

*PSPACE (Polynomial-Space)*    
: the class of problems solvable in polynomial space, but unlimited time

- {Add PSPACE to the diagram}
- Question: Why does PSPACE encapsulate everything?

> - Answer: accessing memory = 1 unit of time; can't access more than poly in poly-running time.
