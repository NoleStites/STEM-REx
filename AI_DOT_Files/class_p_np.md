## Classes P and NP

*P (Polynomial)*     
: the class of problems solvable by a Turing machine in polynomial time     

ex: Searching for an item in a linked list

*NP (Non-Deterministic Polynomial)*    
: the class of decision problems for which, if the answer is yes, then there is a polynomial-size
proof of the fact that you can check in polynomial time     

ex: Given an assignment of variables for a SAT problem, you can easily verify the solution
