## Entanglement

**Wishbone Experiment**:      
Imagine that two people break a wishbone and do not look to see who
got the large piece and who got the small piece. Each person travels home to their part of the globe
and Person 1 looks at their piece and finds that they have the small piece; they immediately know that
Person 2 has the large piece. The result was determined as soon as the wishbone was broken.

Quantum entanglement says that when the two people break the wishbone, they are simmultaneously in
a state where Person 1 has the large piece and Person 2 has the small piece AND the state such that
Person 1 has the small piece and Person 2 has the large piece. It has not yet been determined who has
the large piece and the small piece. The state is a superposition of the two options.

Once Person 1 observes their piece to find that, perhaps, it is the large piece, the information travels
faster than the speed of light to Person 2's piece such that now Person 2's piece take the form of the 
small piece.

**The Bell States**:     

$\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}|00\rangle + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}|11\rangle$    
$\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}|01\rangle + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}|10\rangle$     
$\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}|00\rangle - \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}|11\rangle$    
$\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}|01\rangle - \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}|10\rangle$
