## Class BPP

*BPP (Bounded-Error Probabilisitic Polynomial-Time)*    
: the class of decision problems for which there exists a polynomial-time randomized algorithm
that accepts with probability greater than $\frac{2}{3}$ if yes, or less than $\frac{1}{3}$ if no.

[//]: # ($\frac{2}{3}$ is any constant greater than $\frac{1}{2}$)     
[//]: # ($\frac{1}{3}$ is any constant less than $\frac{1}{2}$)

- {Add BPP to diagram}
- Question: Why are all problems in P also in BPP

[//]: # (Reason: both solve in P time and any problem in P can add randomness and not use it)

- The Sipser-Lautemann theorem states that if P=NP, then P=BPP

[//]: # (There are still problems in BPP with no efficient equivalent in P)
[//]: # (It is widely believed that P=BPP)

- I cannot provide an example problem that is in BPP but not in P

[//]: # (The remaining problems in BPP are not known. Most have been derandomized.)
