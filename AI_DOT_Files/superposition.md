## Superposition

*Superposition*         
: when a quantum object is in multiple states simultaneously, it is said to be in a superposition
of all of the states.

- In quantum computing, superposition is one of the most important tools in a computation.
- Superposition is simulated using the Hadamard gate.

**Schrodinger's Cat Thought Experiment**:       
Imagine a closed box with a cat inside. Also inside the box is a mechanism that will, at some point,
release a poisonous gas that kills the cat. The question is this: is the cat dead or alive at a given
moment in time? 

[//]: # (The cat is in a superposition of dead and alive.)

- Qubits store exponentially more information that a classical bit.
  - This is because a classical bit only represents one binary number whereas a qubit can represent
    all binary numbers with a certain number of digits through superposition.
