## Normalization Constraint

Normalization Constraint     
: Given any number of events, the total of adding all event probabilities together
should equal 100%. In other words, for $x$ total events, 
$$event_x + event_{x-1} + event_{x-2} + \ldots + event_1 = 1$$

Example: There is a red, green, and blue ball in a hat and you must blindly take one
out. The probability of getting the red ball might be $\frac{1}{3}$, as would your
chances of getting the green and blue balls. Overall, the probability of grabbing *any*
ball is $\frac{1}{3}$ + $\frac{1}{3}$ + $\frac{1}{3}$ = 1.
