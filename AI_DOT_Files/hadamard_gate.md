## Hadamard Gate

- Almost equivalent to the "coin flip" gate shown earlier
- 1-qubit gate

> The single most important gate in quantum computing

The Hadamard gate mappings:

$$
|0\rangle \to \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|0\rangle + |1\rangle) \hspace{8em}
|1\rangle \to \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|0\rangle - |1\rangle)
$$

> - There are negative amplitudes, but the chances are still the same.

Question: Considering that the Hadamard gate simulates a coin flip by creating a 50/50 chance of measuring
either 0 or 1, what would you expect to happen when applying the Hadamard gate twice to a qubit?

Exercise: Apply the Hadamard gate twice to a qubit in state 0.

> - Work out the answer on the whiteboard.
> - Notice how the $|1\rangle$ amplitudes cancel. A property of negative amplitudes well used in quantum.
