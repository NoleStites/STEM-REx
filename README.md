# STEM-REx: Introduction to Quantum Computing

This repository contains the materials for a funded undergraduate research project presented through the STEM-REx program. The goal of this project was to develop and deliver an accessible, engaging introductory lecture on quantum computing for computer science students with no prior background in the subject.

## Project Overview

Quantum computing is a rapidly evolving field with the potential to revolutionize areas such as cryptography, optimization, and complex simulation. However, its foundations can be conceptually difficult and mathematically dense. This project breaks down the basics of quantum computing into a digestible and classroom-ready format.

As part of the project:
- I designed an introductory lecture on quantum computing fundamentals.
- The material was presented to a college-level computer science course.
- The session included interactive explanations, visual aids, and analogies to help demystify quantum concepts.

## Repository Contents

- `AI_DOT_FILES/` - The DOT graphs used to represent the structure of the lecture
- `FacultyPresentation/` - The slide deck that I presented to the faculty and sponsors of the STEM-REx experience
- `HomeworkAssignment/` - The homework assignment for the students in multiple formats
- `LectureCode/` - The code examples used during the presentation
- `LectureOutlines/` - The different drafts of the final presentation
- `PresentationForStudents/` â€“ The slide deck from the live classroom lecture and a questionnaire for feedback
- `ResourcesAndNotes/` - Some of the resources that I used during the project

## Topics Covered

- Classical vs. Quantum computing
- Qubits and superposition
- Quantum gates and basic circuits
- Quantum parallelism and entanglement
- Real-world applications and limitations
- Quantum complexity theory

## Objectives

- Bridge the gap between classical CS education and quantum concepts.
- Create a reusable educational resource for future presentations.
- Encourage undergraduate interest in advanced computing technologies.

## Audience

This lecture was designed for upper-level undergraduate computer science students. No prior knowledge of quantum mechanics was assumed.
