
## Concept
Over the summer, conduct research into teaching quantum computing.
NOTE: you are not trying to push the boundaries of quantum computing,

The project will have three pieces:
1. Learn the basics of quantum computing, both the theory and tools.

2. Develop a presentation about your work. This is more meta than the deliverable lecture, as it talks about what you are doing, not just quantum computing.

3. Develop one 2-hour class of material, including lecture and 1 assignment that contains a theoretical component and a hands-on programming component.

#2 is for the faculty, #3 is for the students.


## Resources
- Quantum Computing Field Guide
https://quantum-computing.ibm.com/lab/docs/iqx/guide

- Qiskit Website
https://qiskit.org/

- Qiskit Textbook
https://qiskit.org/learn/


NOTES:
- On the IBM Quantum home page, it gives you an API key; perhaps we can create an assignment that uses the IBM Quantum API on a students' local system to do something.
